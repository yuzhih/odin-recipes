    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Smooth and creamy with the perfect balance of tart and sweet. 
        <br>
        Baked in a ramekin or small baking dish, this classic pie is made with "regular limes" and 
        comes complete with a buttery graham cracker crust. So easy to make</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>For the crust
            <li>¼ cup graham cracker crumbs</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon salted butter, melted</li>
        </li>
        <li>For the filling
            <li>2 large egg yolks</li>
            <li>2 ½ tablespoons lime juice</li>
            <li>¼ cup sweetened condensed milk</li>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <h5>Making the crust</h5>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350° F (177°C). Place 2 sheets of graham crackers in a ziplock bag, seal, and roll with a rolling pin or heavy can to crush. 
            <br> 
            This yields about ¼ cup of crushed graham crackers. Alternatively, 
            you can add the cookies to a food processor and pulse until the cookies turn to crumbs.</li>
        <li>Pour the cookie crumbs into a small bowl and stir in the melted butter.</li>
        <li>Pour the crumbs into a 10-ounce ramekin. Using your fingers or the back of a spoon, press the crumbs gently so they form a crust on the bottom.</li>
        <li>Bake the crust for 15 minutes. Then, remove from the oven and set it aside to cool.</li>
    </ol>
    <h5>Make the filling</h5>
    <ol>
        <li>Mix egg yolks and lime juice in a small mixing bowl.</li>
        <li>Add sweetened condensed milk and whisk until smooth and thick.</li>
        <li>Pour mixture into the crust and bake for 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove from the oven. Allow to cool for about 20 minutes, then refrigerate for at least 3 hours. 
            When you are ready, take it out of the refrigerator, top either the entire pie with whipped cream, or add just a dollop to the top, and enjoy.</li>
    </ol>
